                            <p style="font-family:overpass; margin: 25px 50px;">The major focus of this analysis is the period of June, 2014. For this period a Tableau package was created to explore demographics of gender and age. An in-depth worksheet looks at the time of day ride for each station for each day of the month. Top 10 start stations and bottom 10 stations are visualized in separate sheets. Finally, the system of start stations is visualized in a map. The start station markers are sized and colored by the number of starts to help users find the station by address. The map may be filtered by day of the week. A different pattern emerges for the weekdays than that of the weekends. One key station for the weekdays is located at 8th Ave and W. 31st St. This station is in the near proximity of Penn Station (Amtrak), Madison Square Garden, and the starting spot for many a tour. Similarly, the start station located on E42nd and Vanderbilt is near Grand Central Terminal (MTA Metro North Railway).
        
                      The station located at W 21st and 6th Ave. is near the Empire State Building and Radio City Music Hall is another high count station on the weekends.
                      
                      In addition to the more granular Tableau analysis discussed above, the ridership data for the periods of Q2 2014 and Q2 2019 is analyzed using Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook. Overall ridership for Q2 2014 in terms of recorded trips was calculated as well as the in-quarter percentage growth.
                      
                      Ridership: 2,694,600 recorded trips in 2014 Q2. Percent change for the quarter: 36.433%.</p>
                      
                      <p style="font-family:overpass; margin: 25px 50px;">To look at the changing proportions of annual subscribers:24 hour passes, Q2 2014 was compared to the same
                      period for 2019: In 2014 Q2, the proportion of annual subscribers to 24 hours passes was 1.037:1. In 2019 Q2, the proportion of annual subscribers to 24 hours passes was 0.86:1.
                      
                      The percentage growth from 2014 to 2019 for annual members was 176.57%; the percentage growth for 24 Hour Passes was 232.23%.</p>
